## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Behaviour |

## ⚙️ JavaScript Functionality

All interactivity lives in `js/script.js`:

- **Dark Mode** — Toggles `.dark` on `<body>` and flips sun/moon icon; state persisted in `localStorage`
- **Sidebar** — Opens/closes via `#menu-btn` and `#close-btn`; auto-closes on scroll at `< 1200px`
- **Profile Dropdown** — Toggled by `#user-btn`; closes when search opens (and vice versa)
- **Search Form** — Toggled by `#search-btn`; closes when profile opens
- **Scroll Listener** — Hides all dropdowns on page scroll
